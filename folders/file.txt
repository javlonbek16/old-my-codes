If I talk about an important event in my life, it was an amazing feeling. I met a perfect girl in my life, her name is Lily, that's her English name. I could say. but I don't want to talk about it. because I don't want to lie. I don't think there is an important event in my life, if I remember that my mother woke me up in the morning or that my mother woke me up in the morning, it is a very important event for me.
I want to say at the end of my speech that I don't have many important events. but I think it would be fun to hear someone love you from another person. for example, I heard that my classmate loves me and I felt different.
