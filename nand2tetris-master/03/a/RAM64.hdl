/**
 * Memory of 64 registers, each 16-bit wide.
 * The chip facilitates read and write operations, as follows:
 *     Read:  out(t) = RAM64[address(t)](t)
 *     Write: If load(t-1) then RAM64[address(t-1)](t) = in(t-1)
 * In words: the chip always outputs the value stored at the memory
 * location specified by address. If load == 1, the in value is loaded
 * into the memory location specified by address.  This value becomes
 * available through the out output starting from the next time step.
